# odin-recipes

In this project I intend to demonstrate the ability to build a basic website, which in this instance will be a recipe website consisting of a main index page with several links to recipes, each with relevant content. These individual pages will each contain various web elements which I have learned over the course of the HTML foundations course found on theodinproject.com
